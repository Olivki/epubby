 *
 * A resource is an object that contains  content or instructions that contribute to the logic and rendering of at
 * least one [Rendition](https://w3c.github.io/publ-epub-revision/epub32/spec/epub-spec.html#dfn-rendition) of an
 * [EPUB Publication][Book].
 *
 *  Examples of Publication Resources include a Rendition's Package Document, EPUB Content Document, CSS Style Sheets, audio, video, images, embedded fonts and scripts.
 *
 * @param [identifier] the initial `identifier` of the [manifestItem] that this resource represents
 * @param [desiredDirectory] the [name][Path.simpleName] of the [desiredDirectory]
